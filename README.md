# Bike Share Neural Network

In this project a Neural Network was built from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the project from Github
2. cd into the directory
3. Create a new conda environment:

```
conda create --name dlnd python=3
```

4. Enter your new environment:

4.1 Windows: `activate dlnd`
4.2 Mac/Linux: `source activate dlnd`

5. Ensure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `jupyter notebook` installed by doing the following:
```
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
```

6. Run the following to open up the notebook:
```
jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb
```

7. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project
